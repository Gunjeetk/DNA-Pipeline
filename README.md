# WCSA DNA Sequencing Pipeline

A research-oriented DNA sequencing and candidate alignment pipeline developed for the **NRT Researcher-a-thon**. This repository demonstrates an enhanced sequencing workflow with a **Weighted Column-Sum Alignment (WCSA) scoring engine** integrated into the mapping stage to explore a **hardware-friendly alternative to conventional alignment scoring**.

---

## Problem

Traditional DNA sequencing analysis pipelines spend significant compute time in the **candidate evaluation and alignment stage**, especially after basecalling and candidate window generation. As read volumes grow, this stage becomes a major bottleneck for efficient real-time genomic analysis.

---

## Innovation

This project introduces **WCSA (Weighted Column-Sum Alignment)**, a novel scoring mechanism that reformulates alignment-event detection into a **column-wise weighted sum operation**.

Instead of relying on conventional string-by-string comparison or dynamic programming at every step, WCSA converts aligned bases into numeric digits and computes:

```text
S = ref × 1 + read × α
```

where:

* `ref` = encoded reference base digit
* `read` = encoded read base digit
* `α` = row-weight multiplier (default 5)

This enables:

* simplified match/mismatch/gap decoding
* hardware-friendly arithmetic blocks
* efficient candidate scoring
* future accelerator integration opportunities

---

## Why It Matters

WCSA is designed as a **research prototype for compute-efficient DNA alignment scoring**, with strong relevance to:

* nanopore-style streaming pipelines
* hardware acceleration research
* near-memory genomic compute architectures
* low-power portable sequencers
* future handheld and edge sequencing devices

The approach is particularly suitable for **publishable architecture and systems research**, where algorithm–hardware co-design is central.

## WCSA Core Scoring Logic

The WCSA engine performs four internal stages:

1. **Base Digit Encoder**
   `A,C,G,T,- → 1,2,3,4,0`

2. **Column-Sum Generator**
   `S = ref + α × read`

3. **Alignment Event Decoder**
   Detects:

   * match
   * mismatch
   * gap

4. **Window Score Aggregator**
   Computes cumulative alignment score across the candidate window.
